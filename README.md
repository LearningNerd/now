# What Liz is Doing Now
*What I'm doing now -- a public list of my current activities, goals and state of mind. Inspired by http://nownownow.com/ as well as http://keepachangelog.com/ (but this changelog is for me/my brain-code rather than actual code)*

## This Month

- **Work:** I'm now finally calling myself a freelance web developer and getting used to the idea that I am indeed a professional and sometimes I even know what I'm doing! Since I recently wrapped up a couple freelance jobs, now I'm going to focus on learning more about programming and fleshing out my (still vague) idea for some sort of interactive tool to use in the programming workshops I've been teaching.

- **Volunteering:** I'm still hosting weekly meetups for Learn to Code LA and teaching workshops twice a month or more. I'm also getting more involved in Girl Develop It as a class coordinator, organizing and teaching a couple paid beginner's programming workshops. Once a month I'm helping organize a happy hour with Pasadena Women in Tech, which I co-founded with two awesome women last month.

- **Relationships:** I'm hanging out with my now-regular group of friends generally every week, I'm still making new friends through all the meetup groups I attend, and I'm still visiting my dad and step-mom every weekend. I haven't been going on any dates, but I'm happy focusing on just developing a solid circle of friends right now.

- **Health:** I had a brief summer cold but now I'm all better and getting back into exercising again. I love my walking commute (which is now also my Pokemon-catching time), I'm eating healthy home-cooked meals almost every day, and I regularly go bouldering at a gym I joined with a few friends. Even though I'm only doing mostly level 0 and 1 routes, I still get a good workout every time and really enjoy it! I'm also thoroughly enjoying my evening group hikes, which I usually do once a week.

- **Side Projects:** I'm learning a couple Cole Porter songs on piano to surprise my dad for his birthday in early September, since Cole Porter is his favorite composer and I think he and my step-mom are getting sick of hearing me practice the same two songs over and over again every time I visit them! I also finally started learning how to sight-read music, using [this open-source web app](http://www.sheetmusictutor.com/) that I really want to extend or modify sometime.

###Goals:
- Wake up between 7am and 8am every day
- Meditate 10 minutes daily
- Practice piano 15 minutes a day (and now practice sight-reading in addition to that, woohoo!)
- Go bouldering at the gym 3 times a week
- Go hiking twice a week
- Eat healthy home-cooked meals 25 days of the month

## The Big Picture
*(Where I'm at in my life, in a nutshell. This section won't be updated as often.)*

- **Work:** I'm making a gradual career shift away from my background in communications/writing/PR and towards the technically challenging fields I used to be intimidated by, like computer science and math. I'm flirting with the idea of becoming a software developer. As always, I don't know what I want. But I'm learning to be embrace the uncertainty.

- **Volunteering:** I'm very actively involved in teaching, organizing and growing Learn to Code LA, the meetup group that I started early last year. I'm also helping out with other organizations like Girl Develop It, Women Who Code, and Pasadena Women in Technology.

- **Relationships:** I feel like I'm still learning how to be a "real" adult. I finally have some friends and a very active social life, but I still find all social relationships to be a bit mysterious and complicated. Dating is now a regular part of my life but not a priority. I'm also still getting used to the idea of having older parents; especially after my mom passed away two years ago, this is the primary emotional challenge that occupies my thoughts (and maybe it always has been).

- **Health:** Physically, I'm in excellent health! Mentally, I'm also doing well overall, but I still battle anxiety on a daily basis. I'm definitely not depressed -- in fact, I'm usually quite content and happy! I've pretty much conquered my social anxiety, but I still have some degree of adult separation anxiety (see note about parents above), and I still have the occassional panic attack and almost always feel a bit of general anxiety or existential dread lingering in the back of my mind.
